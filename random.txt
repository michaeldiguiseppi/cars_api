Engine Classifications
1. 4-stroke cycle and 2-stroke cycle naturally aspirated internal combustion
engines will be classified on the basis of actual piston displacement.
2. Supercharged/turbocharged SM and SSM engines will be classified on a
basis of adding 1.4L to the actual displacement. Forced induction SMF engines
will add 1.0L to the actual displacement.
3. Rotary Engines (Wankel): These units will be classified on the basis of a
piston displacement equivalent to 0.9 liters times the number of rotors,
plus the volume determined by the difference between the maximum and
minimum capacity of the working chamber times the number of rotors.
4. Electric Motors: Cars with electric motors, in whole or part of the drivetrain,
will run at class maximum weight (2900 lbs. for SSM, 3100 lbs for
SM/SMF). Category weight adjustments (e.g., tire size) are allowed.

Appendix A - (XP) Prepared
XP vehicles must conform to the rules in Section 17 except as noted herein.
This class is for almost any production car using almost any automobile
drivetrain. Any vehicle meeting the requirements of Section 17.A.2, listed
in another Prepared class, specifically listed in CP, DP, EP, or FP that is not
required to run at Section 17.11.A specified weights or listed at the end, is
eligible for XP. Section 17.11.A does not apply. “In-excess” cars per Section
17.11.A are not eligible for XP.
1. Bodywork and Structure
a. Chassis components attached by removable fasteners (e.g., bolt-on subframes)
may be modified or replaced without penalty.
b. Front hoods, engine covers, trunk lids, hatches, front fenders, rear fenders
not part of chassis structure (unibody), front & rear fascias, and
side skirts may be modified or replaced, and may be attached with removable
fasteners. Associated hardware, including latches and hinges,
may be modified, removed, or replaced. Fenders may be flared as per
Section 17.2. Unibody fender may be replaced as described in Section
17.2.S. Non-metallic fender liners may be modified, replaced, or removed.
Body panels may be attached with removable fasteners (e.g.,
Dzus®).
c. Aerodynamic Aids: Wings may be added, removed, or modified. NonOE
wings may only be attached to the rear deck/hatch area behind the
centerline of the rear axle. The total combined surface area of all wings
shall not exceed 8 sq. ft. (0.7432 m2
) as calculated per Section 12.9. The
number of wing elements is limited to 2. Wings designed to be adjustable
while the car is in motion must be locked in a single position.
Wings, and any component thereof, may not extend beyond the vehicle
width as defined by the outermost portion of the vehicle doors, less
mirrors, door handles, rub strips, and trim. In addition, no portion of
the wing or its components may be more than 6” (15.24 cm) forward
of the rear axle, more than 0” (0.0 mm) beyond the rearmost portion
of the bodywork, or more than 6” (15.24 cm) above the roofline of the
vehicle, regardless of body style. Reinforcements to the wing mounting
area may be used, but may serve no other purpose.
Wing endplate surface area is limited to 200 sq. in. (1290.3 cm2
) each
and the number of endplates is limited to a maximum of 2. For convertibles/roadsters
with no roof and targas with no rear window, no
portion of the wing may be higher than 12” (30.48 cm) above the wing’s
point of attachment to the body of the vehicle. In the event that a convertible/roadster
with no roof or a targa-top with no rear window retains
the OE windshield frame with a windshield of any material that
meets Section 17.2.K.1, the top of the windshield frame shall be considered
the top of the roofline and the car may use the wing mounting
rules in Appendix A.1.c for a closed car.
Canards are allowed and may extend a maximum of 6” (15.24 cm) forward
of front bodywork/fascia as viewed from above. No portion of the
PREPARED CATEGORY
X Prepared (XP)
198 — 2016 SCCA® National Solo® Rules

canard may extend past the widest part of the front bodywork/fascia
as viewed from above. Canard area will be measured in the same manner
as wings using Section 12.10. Canard area may not exceed 1.2 sq.
ft. (1114.8 cm²).
Front splitters are allowed and shall be installed parallel to the ground
(within ±3° fore and aft) and may extend a maximum of 6” (15.24 cm)
forward of the frond bodywork/fascia as viewed from above. Splitters

a. Engine Classifications
1. 4-stroke cycle and 2-stroke cycle, naturally aspirated, internal combustion
engines will be classified on the basis of actual piston displacement.
2. Turbocharged or supercharged versions of all engines will be classified
on a basis of 1.4 times the actual displacement.
3. Rotary Engines (Wankel): These units will be classified on the basis
of a piston displacement equivalent to twice the volume determined
by the difference between the maximum and minimum capacity of
the working chamber, times the number of rotors.
b. Minimum Weight Calculations
All listed weights are without driver. All weights are calculated based
on displacement as listed above. Example: Weight for a RWD car w/
1796 cc Turbo engine behind the driver is 1200 + [(1.796 x 1.4) x (200
+ 20)] = 1753 lbs.
Engine displacement less than 4.0L (lbs.)
FWD........................................................................................1200 + 150 per liter
RWD .......................................................................................1200 + 200 per liter

Unless otherwise listed, the minimum weights will be determined from the
following tables according to engine type and displacement.
Minimum weight is based on actual engine displacement. The block may be
bored and/or sleeved to achieve allowed displacement.
Engine Coolant flow direction is unrestricted.
US-produced 4-cyl, 6-cyl, and 8-cyl engines are allowed alternate-stroke
crankshafts; crank angles must remain standard.
Naturally aspirated cars using US-market 6-cyl and 8-cyl engines manufactured
by a particular corporation may use any naturally aspirated 6-cyl or
8-cyl engine offered in a US-market vehicle by that corporation’s brands as
listed below:
• Ford: Ford, Mercury, and Lincoln
• General Motors: Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, GMC, and Buick
• Chrysler: Chrylser, Dodge, and Plymouth
Alternate engines for a particular model must locate the bell housing to the
block mounting surface in the same plane as the standard part. Vertical position
of the longitudinal axis of the crankshaft shall remain the same as the
original engine. Tolerance for both measurements is ±½” (±12.7 mm). Alternate
material (e.g., aluminum) engine blocks may be used on US-produced
8-cyl engines. Any altenate engine block shall meet all other requirements of
Section 17.
Forced induction cars may not substitute the engine for any other nor may
forced induction engines be swapped into cars that the combination was not
offered.
Engine displacement changes are allowed.
Alternate iron or aluminum cylinder heads may be used on US-produced
4-cyl, 6-cyl, and 8-cyl engines. Any alternate cylinder head(s) shall be of of
the same configuration (number of valves per cylinder and valve actuation
method - e.g., OHV or OHC) as the original and shall be direct replacement
type.
The floor in the driver/passenger compartment may be replaced but must
maintain the basic shape and position of the original floor (i.e., flat and horizontal,
relative to the car and rocker panels). It may not be curved, angled,
recessed, or channeled between the rockers and may be made of steel and/
or aluminum only. Replacement floors may be modified per Section 17.2.E.
The firewall between the engine compartment and driver/passenger compartment
may be replaced but must be in approximately the same location as
the original and must create a sealed bulkhead between engine and driver/
passenger. Replacement firewalls may be made of steel and/or aluminum
only and may be modified per Section 17.2.F.
An alternate hood is allowed which has a bulge no more than 4” (10.16 cm),
measured off of the original base model hood, for induction clearance. The
bulge may open to the front, to the rear, or to either or both sides. If the original
base model hood has a 2” (50.8 mm) bulge, then an addition of 2” (50.8

216 — 2016 SCCA® National Solo® Rules
Prepared (FP) - Appendix A
Wheel size allowances are as per Section 17.4.
Minimum weights are determined by engine displacement. Increases in engine
displacement resulting from legal overbore are not considered in these
calculations.
Wheels up to 10” wide are allowed with no weight increase; a maximum width
of 12” is permitted.
Weight formulas (lbs.):
Piston Engines: 0.75 x displacement (cc)
Rotary Engines: 0.70 x specified displacement (cc)
Forced Induction: + 0.450 x displacement (cc)
Peripheral Port Rotary: + 0.050 x displacement (cc)
Weight Adjustments (lbs):
Wheels greater than 10” wide up to 12” wide: .................................................+100
AWD: + 0.100 x displacement (cc)
FWD: - 0.100 x displacement (cc)
Solid Drive Axle: -0.05 x displacement
Weight Adjustments: Equipment, Weight (lbs.)
Regardless of the weight formulas above no car may weigh less than
1900 lbs. or be required to weigh more than 2700 lbs. prior to addition
of weight adjustments defined herein and in Section 17.
Weight Calculation Example
Subaru WRX STI (2.5 L) with 11” wheel width
Actual displacement (before overbore): 2457 cc
The formula would be: 0.750 (piston engine) + 0.450 (forced induction)
+ 0.100 (AWD) = 1.3 (total weight factor).
Calculated weight: 1.3 x 2457 = 3195 lbs. (exceeds maximum limit).
2700 lbs. (maximum calculated weight) + 100 lbs. (wheel width over
10” weight adjustment) = 2800 lbs. (total competition weight).
